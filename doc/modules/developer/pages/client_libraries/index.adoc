= Client Libraries

Additional client side libraries are provided by Blickfeld for selected languages to speed up the
client development & integration and to ensure that all security features are activated by default.

Intentionally, the client libraries are kept lightweight to avoid dependency conflicts with client applications.
All libraries enable access to the xref:protocol:index.adoc[] and the available methods are auto-generated
from the underlying https://github.com/Blickfeld/blickfeld-qb2/tree/main/protocol[Protobuf Definitions].

The raw gRPC Protobuf files are available on https://github.com/Blickfeld/blickfeld-qb2[Github] and can be compiled for various platforms.
Note that all security-related additions, such as TLS authentication, or automatic decoders of
binary data to platform-specific types need to be done manually.
