= Blickfeld Percept Pipeline

The Blickfeld Percept Pipeline module provides a gRPC interface to configure the processing pipeline.

This pipeline is built by applying various processing steps to the raw data obtained from one or multiple Qb2 devices, with the goal of extracting high-level information, like volume or intrusion status. The different components of this pipeline, including the data source, can be tailored to specific requirements using this module.

Each stage of the pipeline can be individually customized using dedicated services, listed below. These components collaboratively function in a specific sequence to extract high-level insights from the scene.

== Services

Blickfeld Percept Pipeline offers the following services:

* Data Source
* Perception
* Zone
* Health

=== Data Source

The xref:protocol:blickfeld/percept_pipeline/services/data_source.adoc[Data Source service] facilitates the retrieval, configuration, and receipt of updates regarding the data source employed in the processing pipeline. A data source represents a specification for one or multiple devices utilized for collecting point cloud data.

=== Perception

Data obtained from one or multiple devices undergoes processing through various steps to extract high-level information. Depending on the specific application, the xref:protocol:blickfeld/percept_pipeline/services/perception.adoc[Perception service] enables users to access, configure, and receive updates regarding the details of these steps.

=== Zone

The xref:protocol:blickfeld/percept_pipeline/services/zone.adoc[Zone service] permits users to access, configure, delete, and receive updates on the defined zones. A zone is essentially a bounding box placed within the scene, designed for the extraction of high-level information from the data. Examples of these zones include volume measurement zones or security zones, which are used to detect intrusion within specific areas.

=== Health

The xref:protocol:blickfeld/percept_pipeline/services/health.adoc[Health service] provide information about the current status of both the pipeline and the module. Users can utilize this service to retrieve information or stream real-time updates regarding the operational health of the system.
