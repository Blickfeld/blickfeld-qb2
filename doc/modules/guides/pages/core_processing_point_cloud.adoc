= Point Cloud Fetch 
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

In this guide we establish a secure connection to a Qb2 device.
Afterwards, the point cloud data is requested and one or multiple point cloud frames are received. 
Finally, we get data from the received point cloud and plot a single point cloud frame.

NOTE: Please follow the xref:developer:client_libraries/python.adoc[Python Client Library Guide] first to install the Python package.

== Fetch point cloud from Qb2 

We use the ```PointCloud``` service from ```blickfeld_qb2.core_processing.services``` namespace over the gRPC channel and issue a single get (retrieve one point cloud frame) or streaming request (continuously receive point cloud frames) to the device.
The code snippets below show examples of connecting to a Qb2 with hostname ```qb2-xxxxxxxxx``` and fetching point cloud frames from it.

=== Get single frame

The following example shows how to fetch a single point cloud frame using the ```Get``` method.

[source,python]
----
import blickfeld_qb2

# open secure connection to Qb2
with blickfeld_qb2.Channel(fqdn_or_ip="qb2-xxxxxxxxx") as channel:
    service = blickfeld_qb2.core_processing.services.PointCloud(channel)
    frame = service.get().frame
    # print frame id
    print("received frame with id", frame.id)
----

=== Continuously stream point cloud frames

The following example shows how to continuously stream point cloud frames from a Qb2 device:

[source,python]
----
import blickfeld_qb2

# open secure connection to Qb2
with blickfeld_qb2.Channel(fqdn_or_ip="qb2-xxxxxxxxx") as channel:
    service = blickfeld_qb2.core_processing.services.PointCloud(channel)
    # request point cloud stream from Qb2
    for i, response in enumerate(service.stream()):
        # extract point cloud frame from response 
        frame = response.frame
        # print frame id
        print("received frame with id", frame.id)
        # get 3 frames and stop 
        if i == 2: 
            break
----

== Get data from point cloud frame
In the code snippet below we read out the cartesian coordinates ```xyz``` for each point in the received point cloud frame.
We further use these values to calculate azimuth and elevation vectors. 

[source,python]
----
import numpy as np

# get x,y,z coordinates from the frame points 
xyz = frame.binary.cartesian

# calculate azimuth and elevation 
distance = np.sqrt(xyz[:,0] ** 2 + xyz[:,1] ** 2 + xyz[:,2] ** 2)
azimuth = np.arctan(xyz[:,0] / xyz[:,1])
elevation = np.arcsin(xyz[:,2] / distance)
----

== Plot point cloud frame 

Finally, ```azimuth```, ```elevation``` and ```photon_count``` vectors are used to plot the desired field of view from the point cloud frame as shown in the code snippet below.

[source,python]
----

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

index = np.argwhere((azimuth > np.deg2rad(20)) & (azimuth < np.deg2rad(30)) & (elevation > np.deg2rad(5)))
plt.scatter(azimuth[index], elevation[index], c=frame.binary.photon_count[index], s=0.1)
plt.xlabel("Azimuth [rad]")
plt.ylabel("Elevation [rad]")
plt.show()
----

The plot result is shown in the Figure below:
