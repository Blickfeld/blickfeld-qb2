Blickfeld Qb devices support wired connection over Ethernet and wireless connection over WiFi for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.

== Accessing the Qb device
By default, each Qb device is configured to use DHCP and will attempt to automatically retrieve an IP address from the network. Initially, the GUI of the Qb device can be accessed from any internet browser via the wired Ethernet connection using the hostname printed on the device's label. Once connected, further network configuration can be performed via the Network Setup page. The Network page of Qb device with the hostname ```qb2-ABC123XYZ``` is shown below.

Once the initial connection is established, the hostname can be changed to the desired one using the ```Device name``` option. To connect the Qb device to the wireless network, set the SSID and network password via the corresponding ```Wireless``` submenu.

NOTE: Wired Ethernet connection will be disabled when the wireless WiFi connection is in use! In this case, the ethernet plug is only used to power Qb device.

NOTE: Always use the ```validate``` button of the Network Setup page to ensure that the desired wireless credentials are correct. If the credentials are incorrect, the previous network configuration will be kept.

== Fall-back IP Address
All Qb devices have a pre-configured fallback IP address, which is ```192.168.26.26``` in the ```255.255.255.0 (/24)``` subnet. If there are any connectivity issues or a possibly incorrect configuration, the address can be used for a reconfiguration. To successfully establish a connection, it is required that the client uses an IP address in the same address and subnet, e.g., ```192.168.26.25/24```. It is not recommended to use the fallback IP address in production environments, as it causes conflicts in networks with multiple devices.

NOTE: If a network connection cannot be established, or if the network mode is unclear, the fallback IP address ```192.168.26.26/24```can always be used via the Ethernet interface for a device's network reconfiguration. Please refer to the FAQ section of the documentation for more information.

Please use manual IP configuration if DHCP is not available. The description of the Qb device networking modes and their configuration for both wireless and wired connections is explained in the subsection below.

== Network Modes
The following operation modes are supported by Qb devices: automatic network configuration via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), manual network configuration and Link-Local network configuration.

=== DHCP configuration (Default)
If the Qb device is used in a managed network, it can be configured to use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to automatically retrieve an IPv4 or IPv6 address from the network router. Enable this mode by using the corresponding ```Automatic IP address (DHCP)``` toggle.

=== Manual configuration
If the Qb device is used in an unmanaged network, a static IP address and subnet can be manually configured for IPv4 or IPv6 protocols in the corresponding ```IPv4 settings``` or ```IPv6 settings``` submenus.

=== Link-Local configuration
If the Qb device has not been configured manually or automatically by a DHCP server, a link-local IP address can be acquired within the subnetwork that the Qb device is connected to. The IP address will be automatically chosen from the particular reserved range of IP addresses via Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): ```169.254.0.0-169.254.255.255``` for IPv4 and ```FE80::/10``` for IPv6.

NOTE: Both DHCP and Manual modes can be applied together. In this scenario, static configuration will be used if DHCP configuration fails.

After configuring the network mode, the settings are applied using the respective button. The applied configuration is persistent and will be active again after the Qb device is rebooted.
