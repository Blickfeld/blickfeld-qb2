This section provides information on how to integrate QbProtect with Avigilon Unity VMS. Please refer to the xref:onvif/index.adoc[ONVIF section] beforehand for general information on using ONVIF with https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect].

[NOTE]
====
The following Avigilon Unity components have been used in the examples below:  

* Avigilon Unity Client - Version 8.6.0.8 (build 1746566476)
* Avigilon Unity Admin Tool - Version 8.6.0.8
* Avigilon Unity Server - Version 8.6.0.8

== Add Device

The Avigilon Unity Client is used to add https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] into Avigilon Unity VMS.

The procedure includes the following steps: 

. Launch the Avigilon Unity Client and connect to the active Avigilon Unity server instance using `Site Login` tab
. Navigate to `Site Setup` tab -> Select the active server instance -> Click `Connect/Disconnect Devices`

. Click `Find Device` ->  Set `Device Type` to `ONVIF` -> Enter the FQDN or IP of QbProtect in the `Hostname` field and `Username/Password` in the corresponding credential fields -> Click `OK`

+
[NOTE]
====
Please refer to the xref:onvif/index.adoc#user-authentication[User Authentication (ONVIF/RTSP)] subsection to find out how to obtain valid ONVIF credentials required for QbProtect VMS integrations.

The live video stream of the https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] point cloud can be accessed and observed in Avigilon Unity after succesfully completing the required steps above.

== Events

The example below shows how https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] events can be used to trigger alarms in Avigilon Unity VMS. After QbProtect has been xref:onvif/avigilon.adoc#add-device[added to the Avigilon Unity], it can be configured to use QbProtect events for alarm generation. In this example, the QbProtect `TamperingMoved` event is used to exemplify the configuration process.

[[configure-events]]
=== Configure Events Handling 
The events configuration procedure includes the following steps: 

. Launch Avigilon Unity Client and connect to the active Avigilon Unity Server instance (optional)
. Navigate to `Setup` tab -> Click on the added QbProtect -> Click `ONVIF Event Subscription`
+

. Click `Add` -> The drop-down menu will show the list of exposed ONVIF events
+
.QbProtect events: exposed ONVIF events

[NOTE]
====
Events originating from dynamic event sources (e.g., intrusion events from a particular security zone) have to be correctly exposed to the VMS each time when a new zone configuration is introduced via xref:introduction:index.adoc[WebGUI]. Please re-add QbProtect in Avigilon Unity Client to re-expose new events from dynamic sources.
====

[[configure-alarms]]
=== Configure Alarm Rule Chain
The Avigilon Unity alarm rule chain consists of event source (`ONVIF Event Started` and `ONVIF Event Ended` hooks) and event action. It allows to map a dedicated action (e.g., a particular alarm, recording of the video stream.etc) to the event of the particular type (e.g., motion, zone intrusion). 

The alarm rule chain configuration procedure includes the following steps: 

. Navigate to `Site Setup` tab -> Select the active server instance -> Click `Alarms` -> Click `Add`
. Set Alarm Trigger Source to `External Software Event` -> Click `Next`
+
.Avigilon Unity alarm configuration: trigger source
image::onvif/avigilon/events/alarm_trigger_source.png[800,800]

. Select `QbProtect` as a linked device -> Click `Next`
+
.Avigilon Unity alarm configuration: linked device

. Select users for being `Alarm Recipients` -> Click `Next` -> Skip `Alarm Acknowledgment Action` -> Click `Next`
+
.Avigilon Unity alarm configuration: alarm recipients
image::onvif/avigilon/events/alarm_recipients.png[800,800]

. Give a meaningful name to the configured alarm, e.g. `Alarm Moved` -> Click `Finish`
+

. Navigate to `Site Setup` tab -> Select the active server instance -> Click `Rules` -> Click `Add`
. Toggle the `ONVIF event started` under `Device Events` subsection
+
.Avigilon Unity rule chain configuration: general
image::onvif/avigilon/events/rule_started.png[800,800]

. Click `any ONVIF event` -> Select previously subscribed `TamperingMoved` as an event source
+

. Toggle `Display on-screen message` under `User Notification Actions` subsection
. Toggle `Trigger an alarm` under `Alarm Actions` -> Click `an alarm` -> Select previosly configured alarm `Alarm Moved` -> Click `Next`
+
.Avigilon Unity rule chain configuration: display message and alarm actions
image::onvif/avigilon/events/rule_actions.png[800,800]

. Click `Next` again (skipping the `Digital input` configuration) -> Give a meaningful name to this rule chain, e.g. `Rule Moved` -> Set schedule to `Always` -> Toggle `Rule is enabled` -> Click `Finish`
+

image::onvif/avigilon/events/rule_final.png[800,800]

. Navigate to `View` tab. When the https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] is moved, the `TamperingMoved` ONVIF event and the configured alarm rule chain will be generating an alarm as shown in the Figure below.
