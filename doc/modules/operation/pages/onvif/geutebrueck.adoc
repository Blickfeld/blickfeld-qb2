This section provides information on how to integrate QbProtect with Geutebrueck G-Core. Please refer to the xref:onvif/index.adoc[ONVIF section] beforehand for general information on using ONVIF with https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect].

[NOTE]
====
The following Geutebrück components have been used in the examples below:  

* G-Core Server, G-Set, G-View and G-PLC Simulator - Versions 8.2.0.870
====

[[add-device]]
== Add Device

The G-Set tool is used to add https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] into Geutebrück G-Core VMS.

The procedure includes the following steps: 

. Launch G-Set and connect to the active G-Core server instance
. Navigate to `Media channels/Hardware` -> `Hardware` -> `Hardware module list` -> `Add device` -> `ONVIF IPC IP camera plugin settings` 
. Navigate to `Module channel` -> `Hardware settings` -> give a distinguishable name to the QbProtect device, e.g. `QbProtect`
. Navigate to the `Connection` Tab -> enter the FQDN or IP of QbProtect in the `Hostname` field and `Username/Password` in the corresponding credential fields. 

+
[NOTE]
====
Please refer to the xref:onvif/index.adoc#user-authentication[User Authentication (ONVIF/RTSP)] subsection to find out how to obtain valid ONVIF credentials required for QbProtect VMS integrations.

. Navigate to `Media channels/Hardware` -> `Media channels` -> `Live Streaming` -> select `QbProtect` as a media channel source
. Send these configuration settings to the G-Core server using the corresponding button in the top left conner
. The live preview of the point cloud should be available in the preview window of G-Set

. Launch G-View and connect to the active G-Core server instance
. QbProtect should be available as a video channel source -> Drop it into the G-View viewer

The live video stream of the https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] point cloud can be accessed and observed in Geutebrück G-View after succesfully completing the required steps above.

== Events

=== Configure Events Handling 
The example below shows how https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] events can be used to trigger alarms in Geutebrück G-Core VMS. After QbProtect has been xref:onvif/geutebrueck.adoc#add-device[added to the G-Core], it can be configured to use QbProtect events for alarm generation. In this example, a single security zone called `Security Zone 1` has been configured using QbProtect xref:introduction:index.adoc[WebGUI] as shown in the Figure below.

The events configuration procedure includes the following steps: 

. Launch G-Set and connect to the active G-Core server instance (optional)
. Navigate to `Media channels/Hardware` -> `Hardware` -> `Hardware module list` -> `QbProtect` -> `Module channel`
. Navigate to the `Event handling` tab -> Toggle `Enable Event Handling with...` -> select `WS-BaseNotification`
. Toggle `Send unkown events as...` -> select `OnvifNotificationMessage Action` 
. Send these configuration settings to the G-Core server using the corresponding button in the top left conner
. Trigger the `Get event info!` button to get the list of supported QbProtect events
. The configured `Security Zone 1` topic should be displayed in the list of available events

. Launch `G-PLC Simulator` and connect to the active G-Core server instance
. Server logs should now contain `OnvifNotificationMessage` payloads corresponding to the list of supported QbProtect events

[NOTE]
====
Events originating from dynamic event sources (e.g., intrusion events from a particular security zone) have to be correctly exposed to the VMS each time when a new zone configuration is introduced via xref:introduction:index.adoc[WebGUI]. Please re-toggle `Enable Event Handling with...` to re-expose new events from dynamic sources.
====

=== Configure Rule Chain
The Geutebrück G-Core `Events` can be used to configure simple rules chains, while `Behaviour rules` targeting the more sophisticated configurations. In this example, we will consider the simple event rule chain configuration. The Geutebrück event rule chain consists of event source (`StartBy` and `StopBy` hooks) and event action (`OnStart` and `OnStop` hooks). It allows to map a dedicated action (e.g., manual alarm action, adding entry log, .etc) to the event of the particular type (e.g., motion, zone intrusion). 

The event rule chain configuration procedure includes the following steps: 

. Navigate to `Events/Behaviour rules` -> `Events` -> 'Event List' -> 'Add new event'
. Navigate to `Event` tab -> give a meaningful name to the event in the `Name` field, e.g. `Security Zone 1 Intrusion` -> toggle this event to be `Active`

+

. Navigate to `Alarm` tab -> give a meaningful name to alarm in the `Alarm Name` field, e.g. `Security Zone 1 Intrusion Alarm` -> toggle this alarm to be `Active`
. Navigate to `Media channels` tab of the `Alarm tab` -> Add `QbProtect` as media channel source

+

. Right click `StartBy` hook -> Add -> `Onvif Notification Message` -> Select `QbProtect` as a channel source ->  Set topic name to `tnsblickfeld:ZoneIntrusionSecurityZone1` -> Set `Data name` and `Data value` to `State` and `True` correspondingly

+

. Right click `StopBy` hook -> Add -> `Onvif Notification Message` -> Select `QbProtect` as a channel source ->  Set topic name to `tnsblickfeld:ZoneIntrusionSecurityZone1` -> Set `Data name` and `Data value` to `State` and `False` correspondingly

+
.Geutebrück G-Set: event source stop trigger configuration

. Right click `OnStart` hook -> Add -> `Viewer show alarm by type` -> Select `Security Zone 1 Intrusion` as an `Alarm Type` -> Assign ID to the `Viewer`

+
.Geutebrück G-Set: event action configuration
image::onvif/geutebrueck/events/g_set_onstart.png[800,800]

. Send these configuration settings to the G-Core server using the corresponding button in the top left conner

. Launch G-View to observe raised alarms and alarm history

. Make sure that server alarm processing is enabled in G-View. Navigate to `Options` -> `User Options` -> switch to tabs `Alarms` -> toggle `Process Server alarms'

+

The zone intrusion event in the `Security Zone 1` from https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] and the configured intrusion event rule chain will be generating an alarm in G-View as shown in the Figure below.
