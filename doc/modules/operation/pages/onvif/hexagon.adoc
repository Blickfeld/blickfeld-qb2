= Hexagon

This section provides information on how to integrate QbProtect with Hexagon dC3. Please refer to the xref:onvif/index.adoc[ONVIF section] beforehand for general information on using ONVIF with https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect].

[NOTE]
====
The following Hexagon dC3 components have been used in the examples below:  

* HxGN dC3 Server - Version 9.0.1.216 
* HxGN dC3 Video Client - Version 9.0
====

[[add-device]]
== Add Device

The HxGN dC3 Video Client is used to add https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] into HxGN dC3 VMS.

The procedure includes the following steps: 

. Launch the HxGN dC3 Video Client and connect to the active HxGN dC3 server instance
. Navigate to `Configuration Mode` tab -> Click `Create camera` ->  Give a distinguishable name to the QbProtect device, e.g. `QbProtect`
. Set the `Manufacturer` to `Onvif` Tab -> Set `Type` to `ONVIF Smart Driver`
. Click `Use Authorization` toggle -> Enter the FQDN or IP of QbProtect in the `Hostname` field and `Username/Password` in the corresponding credential fields. 

+
[NOTE]
====
Please refer to the xref:onvif/index.adoc#user-authentication[User Authentication (ONVIF/RTSP)] subsection to find out how to obtain valid ONVIF credentials required for QbProtect VMS integrations.

. Untoggle 'Validate Settings before device creation' -> Click 'Ok' -> Click 'Apply'
. General Information about the added QbProtect should be depicted in section `Encoder/camera` -> 'General'. Device should also pop up in the available 'Cameras' section.

The live video stream of the https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] point cloud can be accessed and observed in HxGN dC3 after succesfully completing the required steps above.

== Events

The example below shows how https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] events can be used to trigger alarms in HxGN dC3 VMS. After QbProtect has been xref:onvif/hexagon.adoc#add-device[added to the HxGN dC3], it can be configured to use QbProtect events for alarm generation. In this example, the QbProtect tampering movement event is used to exemplify the configuration process.

[[configure-events]]
=== Configure Events Handling 
The events configuration procedure includes the following steps: 

. Launch HxGN dC3 Video Client and connect to the active HxGN dC3 Server instance (optional)
. Navigate to `Configuration Mode` tab -> Click `Cameras` (right pane) -> Click on the added QbProtect

image::onvif/hexagon/events/event_configure.png[800,800]

. Navigate to `Camera` settings (left pane) -> `Camera side functions` -> `Motion detection`
. Select `TamperingMoved` event in the `ONVIF events` colomn -> Give a distinguishable name to the event, e.g. `TamperingMovedEvent` -> Click `Apply`` -> Click `Save`
. Navigate to `Configuration Mode` tab -> Select `Cameras` in `Company` pane -> Click on `QbProtect` camera -> Navigate to `General` -> `Encoder/camera` -> `General` -> Click `Query Device`

[NOTE]
====
Events originating from dynamic event sources (e.g., intrusion events from a particular security zone) have to be correctly exposed to the VMS each time when a new zone configuration is introduced via xref:introduction:index.adoc[WebGUI]. Please either re-add the device to the VMS or navigate to `Configuration Mode` tab -> `Encoder/camera` -> `General` -> Click `Query Device` to re-expose new events from dynamic sources.
====

[[configure-alarms]]
=== Configure Alarm Rule Chain
The HxGN dC3 alarm rule chain consists of event source (`Start` and `End` hooks) and event action (`Actions at start of alarm` and `Actions at end of alarm` hooks). It allows to map a dedicated action (e.g., AlarmWatchDog, recording of the video stream.etc) to the event of the particular type (e.g., motion, zone intrusion). 

The alarm rule chain configuration procedure includes the following steps: 

. Perform the xref:onvif/hexagon.adoc#configure-events[ONVIF events configuration] as shown in the subsection above
. Navigate to `Configuration Mode` tab -> Click `Create Alarm` -> Give a distinguishable name to the alarm, e.g. `TamperingMovementAlarm` -> Click `Ok`
. Navigate to `General` of the opened alarm configuration window -> Toggle `Activated` -> Select `Validity` and color of the alarm
