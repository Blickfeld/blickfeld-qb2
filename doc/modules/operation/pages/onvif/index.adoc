== QbProtect & ONVIF
The https://www.onvif.org/profiles-add-ons-specifications/[ONVIF] standard and corresponding protocol allow seamless integration of compatible IP-based security cameras into existing security enviroments managed by Video Management Systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_management_system[VMS]). The https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] brings the ONVIF protocol support to Qb2 device, and allows to easily use Qb2 as an advanced drop-in replacement of the security camera in already established security environments without extra non-standard configuration overheads.

[NOTE]
====
QbProtect is not yet fully compliant with dedicated ONVIF https://www.onvif.org/profiles/[profiles]
==== 

Even though https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] is not yet fully compliant with a particular ONVIF profile, it brings crucial ONVIF functionality inherent in all security applications: 

* Visual observation of the scene using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Streaming_Protocol[RTSP] video stream of a 2-D projected point cloud
* ONVIF events for alarms generation (e.g. motion, intrusion)

[NOTE]
====
Configuration of the particular alarm rule chain is VMS specific and has to be configured by the user / integrator. Please refer to the VMS subsection below for examples! 
==== 

== Video Management Systems (VMS)

Due to the interoperability of the ONVIF protocol, https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] is not restricted to a particular VMS manufacturer and may work with any VMS supporting ONVIF, however it is actively tested against confined number of VMS systems listed in <<vms-table,Table {counter:table}>> below.

Integration and configuration instructions and usage examples of https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] with a particular VMS system can be accessed from the corresponding VMS column or the matching documentation subsection.

== Video Stream (RTSP) 

In addition to VMS systems support, https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] allows direct video stream consumption of a point cloud using the RTSP stream source link of the following format `rtsp://qb2-ABC123XYZ.muc.blickfeld.com:554/local/pointcloud/core`. The demonstation of direct video stream consumption using VLC player is shown in the Figure below.

In case user management was enabled on https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] the video stream URL should also include ONVIF/RTSP credentials pair in the following format:  `rtsp://user:key@qb2-ABC123XYZ.muc.blickfeld.com:554/local/pointcloud/core`. Please refer to the section below to see how to obtain the required credentials pair.

[[user-authentication]]
== User Authentication (ONVIF/RTSP)

In order to add https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] to a VMS or/and obtain the RTSP video stream from the device the user has to generate and provide a valid application key associated with a corresponding user account. 

[NOTE]
====
* Both ONVIF and RTSP are relying on the https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] user management system. User management via ONVIF itself is not yet supported.
* The application key with enabled HTTP option has to be used to establish connection with QbProtect via ONVIF (VMS systems) and/or via RTSP (video players)
====

The valid application key can be generated by enabling the `HTTP authentication` option from the user xref:working_principles:authentication.adoc#_account[account page] as shown in the figure below. Please refer to QbProtect documentation in order to learn more about xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc[user management] and xref:working_principles:authentication.adoc#_application_key[application keys]. 

.Creating HTTP authentication application key suitable for ONVIF/RTSP connections
image::onvif/authentication/create_http_application_key.png[]

The resulting application key (password) in combination with the account user name (login) can be used, when prompted, as credentials pair (login/password) in the VMS or video player (e.g. VLC).

.Resulting HTTP application key
image::onvif/authentication/http_application_key.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* It is only possible to generate a single application key with HTTP option enabled per user account. 
* The generated HTTP application key can be used as a password for VMS systems and video players.

== Events

In addition to the video stream of the security scene, https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] also utilizes ONVIF events which can be used by various applications to fulfill a desired action. The list of supported events, their description, type and mapping to standard events (if applicable) are shown in the Table below. 

.QbProtect ONVIF events
[%header,cols="1,2,1,1"] 
|===
|Name | Description| Availability | Mapping

|MotionAlarm | Motion event in the observed security scene | Static | https://doc.milestonesys.com/latest/en-US/onvifdriver/motion.htm?TocPath=Third-party%20integrations%7CONVIF%C2%AE%20drivers%7CEvents%7C[Motion Alarm]
|Intrusion | Aggregated intrusion event in pre-configured security zones | Static | Custom
|ZoneIntrusion | Intrusion event in the pre-configured intrusion zone | Dynamic | Custom
|HealthFailure | QbProtect is in the failed state (one or more failures). The actual root cause can be found at QbProtect diagnostics page | Static | Custom
|HealthWarning | QbProtect is in the warning state (one or more warnings). The actual root cause can be found at QbProtect diagnostics page | Static | Custom
|TamperingCovered | The mirror of QbProtect has been covered | Static | Custom
|TamperingMoved | QbProtect has been moved or rotated | Static | Custom
|===

Events are categorized based on their source availability and supported mapping. Events which are directly mapped to their existing analog defined by a particular VMS are called `Standard`. Those events contain a definition in the `Mapping` colomn correspondingly. All other events are QbProtect specific and therefore called `Custom`. Events origininating from dynamic event sources (e.g. intrusion event from a particular security zone) are called `Dynamic`. Other events are called `Static`.

[NOTE]
====
The https://www.blickfeld.com/lidar-sensor-products/qbprotect/[QbProtect] has to be re-added into VMS in oder to expose events from dynamic sources newly configured via QbProtect xref:introduction:index.adoc[WebGUI].
