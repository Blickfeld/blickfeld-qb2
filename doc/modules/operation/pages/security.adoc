= Security

With precise 3D point cloud data, Blickfeld LiDAR sensors ensure reliable threat detection, 
minimising false alarms and enabling a dependable response to actual security incidents. 
The accompanying software Percept analyses the real-time, high-resolution point clouds. 

Percept utilizes various detection zones to apply specific algorithms within areas of interest in the point cloud, 
facilitating intrusion detection or monitoring of objects within a zone.
With these exceptional features, the LiDAR security system provides a dependable solution for ensuring reliable security.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensuring an optimal mounting position and using the appropriate number of LiDAR devices are crucial for reliable results.

For instance, if there's a possibility of object occlusion or obstacles within the field of view, 
consider adjusting the mounting position or adding additional LiDARs from various angles. 
Occlusion can significantly impact system performance.

== Security zone

The Security zone operates based on points rather than whole objects. 
While an object may consist of a variable number of points, such as 50 or 100, intrusion in the security zone is determined based on the point count.
Users can set the threshold level, dictating the minimum and maximum points triggering an alarm.

.Example of points inside a security zone (Yellow: Security zone; Green: Points outside the zone, will not trigger an alarm; Red: Points inside the zone, 
will trigger an alarm if they exceed the minimum threshold value and are below the maximum threshold)

IMPORTANT: The number of reflected points from an object within the zone relies on the LiDAR device's scan-pattern, 
necessitating adjustments to prevent false alarms or missed alerts.

IMPORTANT: The quantity of reflected points from an object is dependent on the distance. 
Consider segmenting the zone into multiple sections with different threshold values or incorporating additional LiDARs for enhanced coverage.


NOTE: The location of the points within the zone is inconsequential; surpassing the threshold level triggers an alarm.
