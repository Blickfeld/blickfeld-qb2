# Occupancy Zone
:stem: latexmath

The occupancy zone generates a state which indicates whether the zone is occupied or free. The state changes based on the number of points contained in the zones xref::zone_types/index.adoc#_geometric[cuboid].

## Application

Disabling volume zones:: Depending on the state, the measurement of xref:zone_types/volume.adoc[volume zones] can be disabled. This is useful to exclude measurement outliers if equipment covers parts of the scene during loading or unloading operations.
Basic presence detection:: Detect changes in the point cloud without requiring the change to be detected as an object. This can be useful to detect the state of gates, doors or roller shutters.

## Parameters

See configuration xref:protocol:blickfeld/percept_pipeline/config/zone_algorithm.adoc#_blickfeld_percept_pipeline_config_ZoneAlgorithm_Occupancy[API definition].

### Occupancy conditions

Minimum number of points (default: 15):: The lower threshold of points. When the number of observed points is greater than or equal to the number of minimum points, the zone is considered occupied.

Adaptive baseline time constant (default: 0, unit: stem:[$s$]):: The time constant for adjusting the adaptive baseline. When the value is set to stem:[$0$] (default value), the adaptive baseline calculation is disabled.

Voxel size (default: 0.05, unit: stem:[$m$]):: The voxel size used for downsampling the contained point cloud.

### Output options

Invert state:: Invert the zone output state.

## Algorithm

The algorithm uses its enclosed portion of the xref:zone_types/exclusion.adoc#_algorithm[filtered point cloud] as input data. It operates in three stages:

### Voxel downsampling

Based on the parameter for xref:zone_types/occupancy.adoc#_occupancy_conditions[the zone's voxel size], the contained point cloud is https://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/geometry/pointcloud.html#Voxel-downsampling[down-sampled using a uniform voxel grid]. Each occupied voxel then contains exactly one point by averaging all contained points.

### Count points

The number of points remaining inside the zone after the voxel down-sampling is counted. Before comparing it against the xref:zone_types/occupancy.adoc#_occupancy_conditions[minimum number of points], the xref:zone_types/occupancy.adoc#_state[current adaptive baseline value] is subtracted. The zone is considered occupied if the remaining number of points exceeds the configured threshold.

### Update state

Set the output state to the result from the previous stages. If the xref:zone_types/occupancy.adoc#_occupancy_conditions[invert state] option is enabled in the configuration, the calculated result for the xref:zone_types/occupancy.adoc#_state[Occupied] flag will be inverted.

If applicable, the current baseline value will be updated. The update step uses an exponential filter with the configured xref:zone_types/occupancy.adoc#_occupancy_conditions[adaptive baseline time constant].

## Output

See full xref:protocol:blickfeld/percept_processing/data/state.adoc#_blickfeld_percept_processing_data_State_Occupancy[API definition].


### State

Occupied:: Boolean flag indicating the occupied state.
Number of detected points:: Number of points counted inside the zone.
Baseline:: Current value of the adaptive baseline. The value will always be zero if the adaptive baseline calculation is not enabled.
