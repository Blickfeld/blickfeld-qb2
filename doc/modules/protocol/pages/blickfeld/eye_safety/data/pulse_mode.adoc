| Name | Value | Description

| PULSE_MODE_UNSPECIFIED ^| 0 | Unspecified pulse mode
| PULSE_MODE_A ^| 1 | Default pulse mode providing a high pulse rate for a dense point cloud with sufficient detection rate for most use cases
| PULSE_MODE_B ^| 2 |  Pulse mode with medium single pulse laser energy, balancing between A and C
| PULSE_MODE_C ^| 3 | Pulse mode with high single pulse laser energy, improving detection for far range or low reflectivity at the cost of pulse rate
