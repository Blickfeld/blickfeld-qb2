=== Bounding Box Surface

The maximum surface area between the bounding box's OXZ and OYZ planes 
is used to classify objects based on the limits specified in this message.

3+| The surface area of the objects bounding box 
should be larger than this value to be considered a medium object.

.2+| *large_min_size* | float| - | - 
3+| The surface area of the objects bounding box 
should be larger than this value to be considered a large object.
