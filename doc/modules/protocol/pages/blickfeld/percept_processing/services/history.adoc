= Service: History

NOTE: This API is officially released and maintained.

The history service provides historical data. 
The data is captured event-based e.g. when an intrusion occurs. 
The capture window is +/- 10 seconds around the event. 
The data is intended for event analysis and fine tuning of config. 
 
[NOTE] 
The data is stored in volatile memory thus it is not persisted 
over a power reset of the device. Additionally, only a limited amount is kept.
