[#Set]
== Set

Set device credentials. 
 
[WARN] 
This will override the factory SSL certificate which is provided by the device. 
It will cause problems with inter-device communication, authentication, and Blickfeld client libraries. 
Blickfeld client libraries expect a root certificate which is signed by the Blickfeld device root authority. 
The expected root certificate must then be manually provided via configuration options in the client libraries.
