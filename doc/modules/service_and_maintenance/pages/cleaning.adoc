# Cleaning

- The optical window of the Qb device must be checked regularly for contamination.
- Clean the window, if necessary, using a microfiber cloth damped with a mild window cleaner. The housing may be cleaned in the same way.
- Avoid touching the window with your fingers.
- Do not use aggressive cleaning agents or solvents.
- Do not use paper towels for cleaning as these may scratch the material.
- Avoid using a scratching or rubbing motion on the window.
