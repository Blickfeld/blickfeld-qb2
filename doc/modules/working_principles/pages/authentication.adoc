[IMPORTANT]
====
* This Document applies to Qb2 [.underline]#produced# with the Firmware version https://github.com/Blickfeld/blickfeld-qb2/releases/tag/v2.0[v2.0] and later.
* Qb2 produced and shipped with an earlier Firmware version have to be updated to minimum Firmware version https://github.com/Blickfeld/blickfeld-qb2/releases/tag/v2.0[v2.0] or later.
====

== Overview

The data produced by Qb2 might contain sensitive or even private information. This data is protected from unauthorized access by default. Any client has to authenticate to the device in order to gain authorized access, such as viewing the point cloud or changing device configuration.

* <<_username_and_password,Username and password>> is required to access the web interface.
* An <<_application_key,application key>> is required to access the Qb2 API directly.

== Login

For access to the Qb2 web interface, credentials in the form of <<_username_and_password,username and password>> are required.

[NOTE]
====
Every Qb2 has an initial account with a unique password. Refer to the guide on how to perform the xref:operation:authentication.adoc[initial login] to learn how to access the factory-configured account.
====

=== Initial login

If the Qb2 is in factory configuration (only one account with the default name `admin` exists) it will only prompt for the password. 

.Login screen with Qb2 in factory configuration

=== Username prompt

The login screen will also prompt for the username if more than one account exists or the <<_username_and_password,default account name>> has been changed.

=== Remember me

The _Remember me_ toggle can be enabled before clicking on _Sign in_. This will create a permanent session for the current browser. The permanent session is based on a <<_application_key,application key>> which will also show up in the list of keys associated to the particular account.

== Account

After successful login, the web interface shows the dashboard and an _account indicator_ on the left sidebar. The account indicator provides the logout action and can be used to access the _account page_.

.Account indicator on the left sidebar
image::authentication_account_indicator.png[]

All details of the currently authenticated account are displayed on the _account page_ of the Qb2 web interface.

.Account page on the Qb2 web interface
image::authentication_account_page.png[]

An account contains the following attributes:

* <<_username_and_password,Username and password>>
* <<_application_key,Application keys>>
* <<_access_level,Access level>>
* <<_read_only_mode,Read only mode>>
* <<_state,State>>

=== Username and password

The credentials needed for using the Qb2 web interface are a username and password

The username can be changed when clicking on the value displayed on the account page. Note that no whitespace characters such as kbd:[Space] or kbd:[Tab] are allowed in the username field.

.Changing the account name
image::authentication_edit_name.png[]

The password can be updated by filling out the fields in the `Update password` section of the account page.

[WARNING]
====
If the password for an account is lost and the account can not be recovered (e.g. by doing an xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc#_block_reset[account reset]), please contact xref:service_and_maintenance:customer_service.adoc[Blickfeld customer service].
====

=== Application key

Application keys are the credentials required for accessing the Qb2 API programmatically.

Application keys can be generated on the <<_account,account page>>. An application key can have a optional attribute describing its purpose. Each application key grants access for a certain access level. The access level set to `AUTHORIZED` by default. Once created, the generated secret can be used for xref:developer:client_libraries/index.adoc[direct API access].

Refer to https://github.com/Blickfeld/blickfeld-qb2/blob/main/cpp/examples/authentication/main.cpp[the authentication example] to learn how to use an application key in your application

.Creating application keys
image::authentication_create_appkey.png[]

When an application key is deleted, clients can no longer authenticate using the key.

[NOTE]
====

Admin accounts can create application keys with `ADMIN` access level. To do this, select the corresponding access level during application key generation:

.Creating ADMIN application key
image::authentication_create_admin_application_key.png[]

The result will be an application key with `ADMIN` privileges:

.Resulting ADMIN application key

====

[NOTE]
====

To connect Qb2 to a video xref:operation:onvif/index.adoc[ONVIF compliant Video Management System (VMS)] create an application key with the `HTTP authentication` option enabled:

.Creating HTTP authentication application key
image::authentication_create_http_application_key.png[]

The resulting key in combination with the username can be used as credentials in the VMS.

=== Access level

NOTE: The account access level can only be modified in the xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc[user management] section.

Each account contains an access level (`AUTHORIZED` or `ADMIN`). The functionality of Qb2 is divided into three access levels:

PUBLIC::
Clients with this access level are allowed to read basic device information (firmware version, serial number) and are able to <<_login,login>>.
AUTHORIZED::
Clients with this access level are allowed to modify their own account (e.g. change the <<_username_and_password,account password>>, create <<_application_key,application keys>>), use all other device functionalities (zone configuration, scan pattern, flow etc.) and can do everything allowed with `PUBLIC` access level.
ADMIN::
Clients with this access level are allowed to modify or create other user accounts (see xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc[user management]) and can do everything allowed with `AUTHORIZED` access level.

=== Read only mode

NOTE: The account read only mode can only be modified in the xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc[user management] section.

In addition to the <<_access_level,access level>> there is a `READ_ONLY` flag. When this flag is set, only functionality that does not change any configuration can be accessed. This can be used, for example, to only visualize the current data being produced by Qb2 and ensure that no changes are accidentally made to the general measurement setup.

=== State

NOTE: The account state can only be manually modified in the xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc[user management] section.

The state attribute reflects the lifecycle of an account. The default value for a usable account is `ACTIVE` and can be set to one of the following values:

ACTIVE::
The account is enabled and can be used for authentication.
WAITING_FOR_ACTIVATION::
The account has just been xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc#_create[created] or was xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc#_block_reset[reset]. A new password has to be set during login for account activation.
BLOCKED::
The account has been manually xref::user-management.adoc#_block_reset[blocked] and can not be used for authentication. A manual state change to `ACTIVE` by an admin account is required to unblock this account.

The Qb2 web interface prompts the user to set a new password during the initial login in case the account needs to be activated after it has been xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc#_create[created] or xref:working_principles:user-management.adoc#_block_reset[reset].
