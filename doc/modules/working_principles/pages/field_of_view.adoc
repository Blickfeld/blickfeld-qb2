# Field of View

The sensor continuously scans the surroundings using two scanners in the form of MEMS mirrors. They deflect the laser beam horizontally and vertically to measure a scene in two dimensions. The maximum deflection angles in the horizontal and the vertical direction define the field of view. If the horizontal scanner deflects the laser by + / - 45°, for example, this corresponds to a horizontal FoV of 90°.
